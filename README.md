### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt â€” a hands-on engineer and full-stack developer with deep experience building production-grade software systems, automating infrastructure, and delivering scalable cloud-native platforms. I specialize in developer tools, internal platforms, and SaaS applications that balance performance, security, and maintainability.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a couple of Next-based SaaS products, observability tooling, internal developer platforms, and infrastructure automation
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Effect-TS and advanced OpenTelemetry instrumentation in Next.js
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source tooling for platform engineering and DX
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Go, TypeScript, Terraform, observability, or building SaaS platforms from scratch
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mattcalhoun), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mattcalhoun), or here on GitHub
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™ve traveled to 49 out of 50 U.S. states (just missing Hawaii!)

Most recently served as Principal Engineer at [Cloud Posse](github.com/cloudposse), where I contributed to open-source tooling, delivered large-scale platform initiatives, and launched [Atmos Pro](https://atmos-pro.com)â€”a SaaS control plane for GitOps-based infrastructure management.
Former founding engineer at [Gruntwork](https://github.com/gruntwork-io), where I helped build [Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) into industry-standard tools for infrastructure automation. 
I bring the execution focus of an IC with the perspective of a founder or CTOâ€”able to dive into the weeds without losing sight of strategic outcomes.

Thanks for stopping by!
