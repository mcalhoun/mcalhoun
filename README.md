Currently working as Principal Engineer at [Terramate](https://github.com/terramate-io), where I'm working on enhancing the Terramate CLI and Terramate Cloud to help teams define infrastructure more quickly and consistently as part of our mission to make Infrastructure as Code accessible for everyone and accelerate IaC adoption across organizations of all sizes.

Previously served as Principal Engineer at [Cloud Posse](github.com/cloudposse), where I contributed to open-source tooling, delivered large-scale platform initiatives, and launched [Atmos Pro](https://atmos-pro.com)â€”a SaaS control plane for GitOps-based infrastructure management.

Former founding engineer at [Gruntwork](https://github.com/gruntwork-io), where I helped build [Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) into industry-standard tools for infrastructure automation.

I bring the execution focus of an IC with the perspective of a founder or CTOâ€”able to dive into the weeds without losing sight of strategic outcomes.

Thanks for stopping by!
